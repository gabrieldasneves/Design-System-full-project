# Design-System-full-project

## This project was developed in Rocketseat's Ignite Lab. I could learn and practice several tools for building a Design System such as Figma, React, StoryBook and TailwindCSS.

Design patterns are solutions to software design problems that you repeatedly encounter in real-world application development. When you start a new project you donÂ´t start coding. First of all we need to define the scope and features of the project. It's applyed in this project. Here I started with figma built interface, components in figma, definning patterns in figma ( colors, sizes, distances, interactions, etc), once in code editor, used Storybook to properly build a documentation to help both designers and programmers.

Technologies used:

* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

In this project I was able to learn how to assemble a visual structure with Figma and how to port it to the code, also making data available for component testing via StoryBook, automated deployment with GitHub Actions and Front-End simulation in Vite.
